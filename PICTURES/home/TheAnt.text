<html><body><h1>The Ant and the Grasshopper</h1><p>Once upon a time, there were two best friends an ant and a grasshopper. The grasshopper liked to relax the whole day and play his guitar. The ant, however, would work hard all day. He would collect food from all corners of the garden, while the grasshopper relaxed, played his guitar, or slept. The grasshopper would tell the ant to take a break every day, but the ant would refuse and continue his work. Soon, winter came; days and nights became cold and very few creatures went out.<br>On a cold day of winter, a colony of ants was busy drying out some grains of corn. The half-dead grasshopper, cold and hungry, came up to the ant who was his friend and asked for a piece of corn. The ant replied,We work day and night to collect and save up the corn so that we don’t die hungry on cold winter days. Why should we give it to you?The ant further asked, What were you doing last summer? You should have collected and stored some food. I told you as much before.<br>The grasshopper said,I was far too busying singing and sleeping.The ant replied, You can sing all winter as far as I am concerned. You will not get anything from us.The ant had enough food to last through the winter, without any worries at all, but the grasshopper didn’t and he realised his mistake.</p></body></html>
